# Build Prompt for Claude Code

Copy and paste this into Claude Code after running `claude` in this directory:

---

Build the charge recorder app according to the CLAUDE.md specification.

Create the complete implementation:
1. First create requirements.txt with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, uvicorn, python-dotenv
2. Create models.py with the ChargingSession SQLAlchemy model
3. Create routes.py with all API endpoints
4. Create main.py that ties everything together
5. Create static/index.html with the complete frontend
6. Create .env.example

Keep it minimal - no extra features beyond the spec.
